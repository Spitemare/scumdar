Scumdar
=======
Handy stuff for mafia on [MTG Salvation](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/forumdisplay.php?f=186). [Install it!](http://goo.gl/g5k9g)

What is this?
-------------
Scumdar is a set of handy tools for playing mafia on MTGS. If you've never played mafia, I highly suggest that you give it a try. You'll probably want to read up on the [rules](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=151417) first.

So Scumar includes some useful stuff that hopefully makes your mafia bookkeeping easier. Here's a list of what Scumdar offers:

* Star important games and posts
* Make notes on individual posts
* Identify players as town, scum, cult, etc.
* Make notes on individual players
* Score user behavior
* Infinite scroll

Hopefully with all of these features you won't get confused about who is what in your mafia games anymore.

Bugs and stuff
