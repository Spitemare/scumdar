Scumdar

Handy stuff for mafia on [MTG Salvation](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/forumdisplay.php?f=186). [Install it!](http://goo.gl/g5k9g)

What is this?
-------------
Scumdar is a set of handy tools for playing mafia on MTGS. If you've never played mafia, I highly suggest that you give it a try. You'll probably want to read up on the [rules](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=151417) first.

So Scumar includes some useful stuff that hopefully makes your mafia bookkeeping easier. Here's a list of what Scumdar offers:

* Star important games and posts
* Make notes on individual posts
* Identify players as town, scum, cult, etc.
* Make notes on individual players
* Point users from -25 to +25
* Autoload next page

Hopefully with all of these features you won't get confused about who is what in your mafia games anymore.

Bugs and stuff
--------------
If you have any suggestions for future releases, or if you want to report a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Spitemare/scumdar-cr/issues). If you'd like to expand Scumdar to include other mafia sites, drop me a line either by filing an issue or emailing me at dmorgan81_at_gmail_dot_com. I'm more than happy to help expand Scumdar's userbase. :)
